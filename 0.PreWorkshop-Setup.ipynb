      "We will be using Python 2.7 with [Ipython](http://ipython.org) notebooks, as well as [Theano](deeplearning.net/software/theano).

      "\n",
      "* If you don't have Python installed yet, you can use a distribution like [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/) (previously EPD) . Note that this distribution is only free if you are affiliated with a university.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Anaconda is another Python distribution that is generally free, but under Windows I had problems getting theano to work with this distribution. \n",
      "\n",
      "* If you are using Windows, and you don't have access to Enthought or it is not working for you, see below on to help you install the environment from scratch.\n",

      "* We don't recommend using virtual environments for Windows (unless you are an expert).\n",

      "* Install the 2.7 32-bit version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
      "\n",
      "* Install MinGW following [these instructions](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started).\n",
      "\n",
      "* Put the path to MingW into your path environment variable. You can access the variable by hitting win+S and searching for 'environment'. Then choose the path variable for your account and add ';C:\\MinGW\\bin' to the end. \n",
      "\n",
      "* Use the pre-compiled packages provided by [Christoph Gohlke](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) to install 'numpy-mkl', 'scipy',  'theano', and 'pip'.\n",

      "\n",

      "The installation of Theano involves very basic git commands. If you don't care about the specifics you most probably will be able to finish the installation by just copy and pasting the commands from the Theano installation documentation. If you would like to get some more input on what you are doing, here are some useful resources:\n",
      "\n",
      "* First of all, it does not hurt to just google `git tutorial` and have a look at some of the pages.\n",
      "* There  is a nice [interactive tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) from Github. \n",

      "## Installing Theano\n",
      "Theano is a great library for deep learning, even providing transparent execution of your code on the GPU (though only on NVIDIA GPUs). The developers did a great job not only with the library itself, but also with the documentation. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the workshop you should have a working installation of Theano on the CPU, GPU processing is optional and will make computations much faster, but might be not suitable for your laptop configuration. \n",
      "\n",
